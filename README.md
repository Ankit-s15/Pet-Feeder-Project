## Pet-Feeder-Project Assignment for IIT

# Project Overview 
This repository contains the files for Assignment 1 – The Solving Problem Process (Introduction to Information Technology, University of Canberra) for semsester 2 2025.  
The project demonstrates the design, planning, and testing of a low-cost, automated pet feeder system using the structured problem-solving process.
The feeder system is designed to:
- Dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times
- Monitor food consumption using sensors
- Alert staff when issues occur (e.g., food not eaten, food bin empty)

# Features
- Scheduled Feeding – Dispenses food automatically at programmed times
- Food Availability Check – Verifies whether enough food is in the hopper before dispensing
- Consumption Monitoring – Tracks whether the pet has eaten within the expected time
- Error Alerts – Sends alerts when:
  - Food bin is empty
  - Pet has not eaten
- Event Logging – Records successful and unsuccessful feeding events
- Configurable Design – Feeding times, portion size, and monitoring rules can be adapted
